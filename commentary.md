# Challenge Commentary
Here I leave my commentary as I am about to solve this challenge over this weekend.

## Summary
Summary: not too hard, not too easy.

It was an interesting challenge for me to use TypeScript and Angular having
 come from JSX and React background. The overall management is the same,
 except the usage of effects (React developers normally use sagas).  

### Task 1
> Difficulty: easy

Easily understood the code architecture.

### Task 2
> Difficulty: scary hard

Understanding the architecture was tough. Took 5+ hours to add a single 
eature.
  
### Task 3
> Difficulty: hard

Having never done e2e before, it was hard for me to write the tests for
the snackbar. For example, the snackbar would simply vanish even before
the statement executes. The fuel was further added by a 30 sec

### Task 4
> Difficulty: easy

Minor difficulty with git, but resolved with a victory claim.
